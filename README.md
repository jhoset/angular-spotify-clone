**Key Features:**

* **Modern Angular Architecture:** Utilizes signals (a new reactivity primitive in Angular) for improved performance and a simpler development experience. 
* **Redux-like State Management:**  Implements a centralized store for managing global application state, similar to Redux, providing predictable state updates and improved code organization.
* **Music Playback:**  Allows users to play music from their Spotify playlists (requires authentication via the backend).
* **Component-Based UI:**  Built with a reusable component structure, promoting code maintainability and scalability.
* **Rich User Interface:**  Includes custom directives and components to create an engaging and interactive Spotify-like experience.
